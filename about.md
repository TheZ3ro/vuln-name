>Here’s how it works.
>
>A researcher first finds vulnerability in a widely-used library: the more widely-used, the better, since nobody cares about a vulnerability in Digital Buggy Whip version 1.0 that is, like, so two decades ago and hardly anybody uses. OpenSSL has been a popular target, because it is very widely used so you get researcher bragging rights and lots of free PR for finding another problem in it.
>
>Next, the researcher comes up with a catchy name. You get extra points for it being an acronym for the nature of the vulnerability, such as SUCKS – Security Undermining of Critical Key Systems.
>
>Then, you put up a website (more points for cute animated creature dancing around and singing the SUCKS song). Add links so visitors can Order the T-shirt, Download the App, and Get a Free Bumper Sticker! Get a hash tag. Develop a Facebook page and ask your friends to Like your vulnerability. (I might be exaggerating, but not by much.)
>
>Now, sit back and wait for the uninformed public to regurgitate the headlines about “New Vulnerability SUCKS!” If you are a security researcher who dreamed up all the above, start planning your speaking engagements on how the world as we know it will end, because (wait for it), “Everything SUCKS.”

Summarizing:

* It creates excessive focus on issues that are not necessarily truly critical
* It creates grounds for confusion (as opposed to using CVEs)

Here every vulnerability is listed with its own CVE links (NVD/MITRE), CVSS rate and "official" site (if any).
We're here to make things more clear.
